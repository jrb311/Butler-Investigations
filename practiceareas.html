                      Butler Investigations has a proven track record of locating hard-to-find witnesses. For example, John
                      regularly located witnesses in decades-old criminal matters as staff investigator at the Pennsylvania Innocence Project. 
                      In such cases, witnesses had relocated, changed jobs, and even changed identities, and the leads to finding them were few and far between.
                      John knows that sucessfully tracking down witnesses depends on a number of investigative methods, including open source intelligence gathering,
                      public records searches, and field work.

                      John Butler has interviewed and taken written statements from hundreds of witnesses in high stakes and sensitive circumstances. 
                      He understands that the witnesses involved in his cases are human beings with personal - and often tragic - stories to tell, and 
                      he endeavors to make them feel heard and appreciated for their contributions to the case. For Butler Investigations, conducting interviews
                      is about more than just asking questions; it is about developing relationships and building trust. This approach ensures that your organization  
                      will receieve the best quality information possible from any human source in your case.
